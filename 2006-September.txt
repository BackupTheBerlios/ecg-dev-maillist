Subject: [Ecg-dev] Patch for FileWriter
Message-ID: <B11A7FFF8FCDC14880468DC93015D7AC0439EE@spree.pcpool.mi.fu-berlin.de>

Hi ECG users,

I discovered an annoying behaviour of ECG: In case the events file to be
written is *explicitly* specified in the setup file of ECG Lab, every
time the Lab starts, this file will be overwritten and each written
event from previously runs will be lost. Starting Eclipse with the
Inline ECG is just a special case of this.

With unaltered installations of ECG (and Inline ECG) the problem does
not appear since for the default file {home}/ecg_log/out.log this
behavior does not apply. But some of you may have changed the setup file
by including lines like the following in the <properties> section of the
File Writer module:

<property>
<name>
Output File
</name>
<value>
C:\events.log
</value>
<type>
java.io.File
</type>
</property>

The defect may be resolved by overwriting the folder
ECG_FileSystemTargetModule in 
* for Inline ECG:
{eclipse}\plugins\org.electrocodeogram.sensor.eclipse_1.1.3\ecg\modules\

* for stand alone Labs: {ECGLab}\ecg\modules\
with the version in the attachments of this mail. The Lab (in Inline
mode: Eclipse) needs to be restarted after patching. Although not
testet, the patch should also work with version 1.1.2 of ECG.

In case of any problems please don't hesitate to contact me directly.

Cheers,
Sebastian
